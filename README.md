### It's nice to 'e-meet' you ðŸ‘‹

I am Niko!

I am a Web Developer - more specifically I work with React, ES6, HTML, custom CSS but also CSS frameworks like Bootstarp.
Although I am a big fan on Front end development, I also like to experiment and work with backend technologies like Node.js, Express and Databases like mongoDB or SQL.

Feel free to explore my [portfolio](https://nikogermano.com/) to review and demo some of the projects I have worked on. 
All of my projects are hosted and live, giving you an interactive experience of my work!
